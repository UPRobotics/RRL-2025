# Window Scaling Improvements

## Changes Made to Fix Maximization Issues

### 1. Adaptive Grid Layout
- **Before**: Fixed small camera frames that left empty space when maximized
- **After**: Grid layout now scales to larger sizes (1600px target width)
- Individual camera frames scale from 640x360 to 800x450 in grid mode
- Text overlays scale proportionally with frame size

### 2. Enhanced Fullscreen Mode
- **Before**: 720p fullscreen with fixed dimensions
- **After**: Up to 1080p fullscreen that adapts to window size
- Maintains aspect ratio while maximizing screen usage
- Smart scaling limits to prevent oversized frames

### 3. Proportional Text Scaling
- All text elements now scale based on frame/window dimensions
- Font sizes, thickness, and positioning adapt to display size
- Overlay heights scale as percentage of frame height (4-8%)

### 4. Smart Initial Window Size
- Window starts at reasonable size (max 1280x720 initially)
- Can be resized or maximized without scaling issues
- OpenCV handles the final scaling to window size automatically

### 5. Improved Overlay Positioning
- Status bars scale as percentage of frame height
- Margins and text positioning scale with frame dimensions
- Better visibility on both small and large displays

## How It Works

### Grid Mode (2x2 layout)
- Creates larger individual frames (800x450 instead of 640x360)
- Forms a 1600x900 total grid that scales well when maximized
- OpenCV automatically fits this to the actual window size

### Fullscreen Mode
- Uses up to 1920x1080 resolution for single camera
- Maintains camera's aspect ratio
- Scales all overlays proportionally

### Adaptive Scaling
- All UI elements scale based on frame dimensions
- Text remains readable at any window size
- No more empty space when maximized

## Result
✅ **Fixed**: No more huge empty space when maximizing the window
✅ **Enhanced**: Better visual quality at all window sizes
✅ **Maintained**: All existing functionality preserved
✅ **Improved**: Better text readability and UI scaling

The application now provides an optimal viewing experience whether in a small window, resized, or maximized!
