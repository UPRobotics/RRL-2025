# Dual Stream Implementation Summary

## âœ… COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Configuration Support
- **Config file updated** with both main and low-res URLs for each camera
- **CameraConfig class enhanced** with `get_camera_lowres_urls()` method
- **Automatic detection** of available dual stream support per camera

### 2. Camera Class Enhancements
- **AdvancedRTSPCamera class updated** to support dual URLs
- **Stream switching method** `switch_stream_quality()` implemented
- **Current stream tracking** with `get_current_stream_info()` method
- **Automatic reconnection** when switching between streams

### 3. User Interface
- **'L' key handler** added to display loop for stream quality toggle
- **Visual indicators** in camera overlays showing current stream (MAIN/LOW-RES)
- **Color coding**: Green for main stream, Yellow for low-res stream
- **Status text updates** in both grid and fullscreen modes

### 4. Operational Modes
- **Grid mode**: Press 'L' to toggle ALL cameras simultaneously
- **Fullscreen mode**: Press 'L' to toggle ONLY the current camera
- **Seamless switching** with automatic reconnection and health monitoring

### 5. Documentation
- **DUAL_STREAM_SUPPORT.md** created with comprehensive usage guide
- **Updated run_cameras.sh** with new control information
- **Enhanced startup info** showing dual stream capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ HOW TO USE

### Configuration Setup
```ini
[cameras]
# Main streams (high resolution)
camera1_url = rtsp://192.168.0.200:554/stream1
camera2_url = rtsp://192.168.0.201:554/stream1  
camera3_url = rtsp://192.168.0.202:554/stream1
camera4_url = rtsp://192.168.0.203:554/stream1

# Low resolution streams (for 'L' key switching)
camera1_url_lowres = rtsp://192.168.0.200:554/stream2
camera2_url_lowres = rtsp://192.168.0.201:554/stream2
camera3_url_lowres = rtsp://192.168.0.202:554/stream2
camera4_url_lowres = rtsp://192.168.0.203:554/stream2
```

### Controls
- **'L' key**: Toggle stream quality
  - Grid mode: Switches all cameras
  - Fullscreen mode: Switches current camera only
- **Visual feedback**: Camera overlays show (MAIN) or (LOW-RES)
- **Console logging**: Shows switching activity and results

### Visual Indicators
- **Camera overlays**: `Cam 1 (MAIN)` or `Cam 1 (LOW-RES)`
- **Color coding**: Green text = Main, Yellow text = Low-res
- **Fullscreen title**: Shows current stream quality
- **Status bars**: Include "L:Quality" control reminder

## ðŸ”§ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Stream Switching Process
1. User presses 'L' key
2. `_toggle_stream_quality()` method called
3. Individual cameras' `switch_stream_quality()` methods invoked
4. Camera marks connection as unhealthy to force reconnection
5. Current capture released, new URL set
6. Automatic reconnection with new stream
7. Visual overlays update to show new quality

### Error Handling
- **Missing low-res URLs**: Warning logged, continues with main stream
- **Connection failures**: Automatic retry with health monitoring
- **Per-camera flexibility**: Each camera can have different dual stream availability

## ðŸŽ‰ READY TO USE

The dual stream functionality is now fully implemented and ready for use. Simply:

1. **Start the application**: `./run_cameras.sh` or `python3 camaras_advanced.py`
2. **Press 'L'** to toggle between main and low-resolution streams
3. **Monitor the overlays** to see current stream quality
4. **Check console logs** for detailed switching information

The system will automatically handle:
- âœ… Stream URL switching
- âœ… Connection management  
- âœ… Visual feedback
- âœ… Error recovery
- âœ… Performance optimization

All cameras now support seamless switching between high and low resolution streams for optimal bandwidth management and viewing flexibility!
